# Transformer Backgammon 🎲🤖

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wmhowell18/claude-code/blob/main/transformer-backgammon/colab_tpu_training.ipynb)

A GPU/TPU-optimized backgammon AI using transformer neural networks, built with JAX/Flax.

**Quick Start:** Click the badge above to train on Google Colab TPU (free!)

## Project Overview

This project implements a modern, GPU-efficient backgammon bot using:
- **Transformer architecture** for position evaluation
- **TD-learning** with experience replay (inspired by TD-Gammon and Jacob Hilton's work)
- **JAX/Flax** for GPU acceleration
- **N-ply lookahead** with dice averaging for move selection

### Goals

1. **GPU Efficiency**: Leverage modern GPU parallelization to evaluate thousands of positions simultaneously
2. **General-Purpose Architecture**: Minimal hand-crafted features - let the transformer learn strategy
3. **Strong Play**: Target 80-90% of XtremeGammon's strength at 2-5× speed
4. **Open Source**: Provide a modern reference implementation for backgammon AI research

## Architecture

```
Input (Board State)
    ↓
Encoder (26 positions → feature vectors)
    ↓
Transformer Encoder
  - Multi-head Self-Attention (learns positional relationships)
  - Feed-Forward Networks
  - Layer Normalization
  - Residual Connections
    ↓
Global Pooling (sequence → fixed representation)
    ↓
Output Heads
  - Value Head → Equity (win/gammon/backgammon probabilities)
  - Policy Head → Move probabilities (optional)
```

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Board Representation**
- 26 positions as sequence: [bar] + [points 1-24] + [off]
- Each position = token with features
- Self-attention learns relationships between positions

**2. Encoding Options** (configurable)
- Raw: Just checker counts (most general)
- One-hot: Discrete representation
- Geometric: Add positional info (distance to home, etc.)
- Strategic: Include features like blots, anchors (optional)

**3. Training Approach**
- Self-play game generation
- TD(0) learning with dice averaging (Jacob Hilton's insight)
- Experience replay buffer
- GPU-batched training

**4. Move Selection**
- 0-ply: Direct network evaluation
- 1-ply: Evaluate all moves, average over 21 opponent dice rolls
- 2-ply: Extend to opponent responses (GPU-parallelized)

## Key Insights from Literature

### TD-Gammon (Tesauro, 1995)
- Self-play TD-learning achieves master-level play
- Hand-crafted features improve from intermediate → master level
- ~1.5M games needed for convergence

### Jacob Hilton's Implementation
- TD(0) with dice averaging works well
- 1-ply lookahead: evaluate all moves, average over opponent dice
- 2,500 games → 41% vs GNU BG (grandmaster level)
- Experience replay + Adam optimizer

### Stochastic MuZero (2022)
- AlphaZero-style approach CAN work for backgammon
- Matched GNU BG Grandmaster with learned model
- Shows general-purpose approaches are viable

### Our Innovation
- **Transformers** for learning positional relationships
- **GPU parallelization** for massive batching
- **Modern architectures** (deeper, wider than historical approaches)
- **Scale** - train for longer with more compute
