## Safety Notes for 7 Months Pregnant

### ✅ SAFE & RECOMMENDED
- Swimming in pools (if not too hot - ideal temp under 32°C/90°F)
- Prenatal/pregnancy massages (avoid deep tissue on certain areas)
- Gentle spa treatments, facials, manicures, pedicures
- Walking in grounds/gardens
- Rest and relaxation

### ❌ AVOID
- Saunas (all hotels have these - don't use)
- Steam rooms (too hot)
- Hot tubs/jacuzzis (too hot)
- Hydrotherapy pools if very hot
- Mud rooms/thermal cabins
- Any treatment over 38°C/100°F body temperature

### 📞 QUESTIONS TO ASK WHEN BOOKING
1. "What is the swimming pool temperature?"
2. "Which prenatal massage do you recommend for 7 months pregnant?"
3. "Can I book the prenatal massage in advance for both days?"
4. "Are there any spa facilities I should avoid at 7 months pregnant?"
5. "Can you accommodate any dietary requirements during pregnancy?"

## My Final Recommendation

### Book: **COWORTH PARK**

**Why:**
1. **Best food** - Michelin star with potential 2-star quality
2. **Confirmed prenatal massages** - 3 different options available
3. **Perfect service** - Dorchester Collection will look after you impeccably
4. **Right aesthetic** - Polo estate = exactly your "old money" preference
5. **Swimming available** - Indoor heated pool (ask about temperature when booking)
6. **Excellent for babymoon** - Discreet, luxurious, romantic

**If Coworth Park is fully booked:**
- **Plan B:** Pennyhill Park (massive spa, 8 pools, confirmed pregnancy-safe options)
- **Plan C:** South Lodge (multiple restaurants, beautiful swim pond, recent spa awards)

**Skip Cliveden for this trip** because:
- No confirmed pregnancy massage (risky for a babymoon)
- Food is excellent but NOT Michelin level (your #1 priority)
- Save it for post-baby celebration when you can fully enjoy all spa facilities

---

## Booking Action Plan

1. **Call Coworth Park spa directly** - Book prenatal massages for both Sat & Sun
2. **Ask about pool temperature** - Ensure it's pregnancy-safe (under 32°C)
3. **Book restaurant** - Reserve Woven by Adam Smith for Saturday dinner
4. **Mention babymoon** - May get upgraded room or special touches
5. **Arrange train transfer** - Pre-book taxi from Virginia Water station
